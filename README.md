#General
It was assumed to be a simple todo app with simple server side on express, but when i returned to this project i realized that i can't handle all  these layers of complexity I added before. ( A lot of "helping" libraries, own-coded helping utilities which don't work properly, so my goal is make it works somehow)

Also the structure of project is awful, and would be simpler completely rewrite entire project than try to refractor it
